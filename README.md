This repository contains a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in [c programming language]. Sorting algorithms are essential tools in computer science and are used to arrange a collection of data elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending.

## Introduction

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, and there are various algorithms to achieve this task. This project provides implementations of several sorting algorithms to help you understand their working principles and compare their performance.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. **Selection Sort**: Selection sort divides the input list into two parts: the left sublist, which is sorted, and the right sublist, which is unsorted. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.

3. **Insertion Sort**: Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It repeatedly takes an element from the unsorted part and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part.

4. **Merge Sort**: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input list into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves into one.

5. **Quick Sort**: Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

6. **Heap Sort**: Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It builds a max-heap (for ascending order) or min-heap (for descending order) and then repeatedly removes the root element, which is the maximum (or minimum), and rebuilds the heap until the list is sorted.

## How to Use

To use the sorting algorithms provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms.git
Navigate to the project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd sorting-algorithms
Choose the sorting algorithm you want to use, and open the corresponding source file (e.g., bubble_sort.py, merge_sort.c, etc.).

Follow the instructions in the comments or documentation within the file to apply the sorting algorithm to your dataset.

Performance
Each sorting algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses in terms of time and space complexity. Understanding the performance characteristics of these algorithms is crucial when choosing the right one for your specific use case.

Here is a summary of the time complexity of the included sorting algorithms in the average and worst cases:

Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
Selection Sort: O(n^2)
Insertion Sort: O(n^2)
Merge Sort: O(n log n)
Quick Sort: O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n log n) on average
Heap Sort: O(n log n)
Keep in mind that the actual performance may vary based on the dataset size, initial order of elements, and implementation details.
